# Setting up Voyage AI API Key

1. Create an account on [Voyage AI](https://www.voyageai.com/).

2. The account needs to be at least Tier 1, which requires a payment for at least $5 to move from Free Tier to Tier 1.

3. Once you have your account set up, navigate to the API Keys section in your dashboard.

4. Generate a new API key (it should start with `pa-`).

5. Copy the API key and paste it when prompted by clicking on the "Set API Key" button.

**Why do you need this?**
The Voyage AI is used to generate semantic embeddings for assembly code, which significantly improves the quality of code similarity search and context retrieval for decompilation prompts.
