VS Code extension designed to help you when decompiling a codebase.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Work in Progress**: This extension is currently under active development. Features and APIs may change.

- **‚úÖ AI Prompt Builder:** Craft high-quality prompts to guide AI in decompiling a function.
- **‚úÖ Automated Code Fixes:** Use plugins to automatically update the code‚Äôs AST, eliminating repetitive tasks and correcting common errors.
- **üöß Agent Mode:** Automatically decompile a given function, until it reache 100% match _(coming soon)_.
- **üöß Integration with [decomp.me](https://decomp.me/):** Create a new scratch from VS Code _(coming soon)_.

## ‚ú® AI Prompt Builder

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/75d801e0-3b28-45b6-adcb-04a4b92c2063

The **AI Prompt Builder** creates context-aware prompts for decompiling a assembly function. It automatically analyzes your codebase to provide the AI with an accurate context for this task.

### How to use it

1. Select an assembly function
2. Run the code action "Build a prompt to decompile it"
3. Get a comprehensive prompt that includes:
   - Real examples from your codebase: Functions that have already been decompiled (found via Git history)
   - Function signatures of dependencies used in the target assembly
   - Clear instructions and formatting rules for the AI

## üîå Kappa Plugins

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ca5beb10-fc7a-423e-a5b4-ba009eac7dad

**Kappa plugins** are scripts that transform the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) of C/C++ code blocks. They can be used to:

- Fix common decompilation errors
- Avoid repetitive tasks

### Example Kappa Plugin Case

For instance: When decompiling [Sonic Advance 3](https://github.com/SAT-R/sa3) using AI, it kept messing up by using raw numbers instead of the proper Q notation. So, we can [`ApplyQNotationPlugin`](./example-kappa-plugins/ApplyQNotationPlugin.js) that catches assignments to `Vec32` using a raw number and replaces it with the Q format.

```cpp
// Before: Raw decompiled code
player.x = 256;

// After: ApplyQNotationPlugin transformation
player.x = Q(1);
```

Check more examples on [`./example-kappa-plugins`](./example-kappa-plugins).

### How to use it

1. Add the plugins in a folder called `.kappa-plugins` from the workspace root.
2. Select a function
3. Run the action `Run Kappa Plugins`
