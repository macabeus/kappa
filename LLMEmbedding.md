Hey, I'm glad to know that you want to go further in the AI field :fizz_yeah: 

So, about what you did: it seems nice to integrate into Kappa.
I'm (almost) finishing my work on adding agent mode to the extension, and I'll hopefully publish it in the next few days.

I was wondering if you could test it out and see if it works?
I'm very focused on releasing the first stable version for my extension. If you want, I can test it after releasing the 1.0 version for Kappa üôè 
Also, I'm not into Wii. I'm mostly working on Gameboy Advance, so it would be harder for me to evaluate how LLM is performing.


btw if you want to go deeper and contribute on Kappa, there is an annoying limitation on my extension: I'm embedding the assembly functions using Voyage (code).
Although it returns excellent embed data, not everyone is willing to spend 5 dollars to use it. It makes the UX very bad.
It would be great if Kappa had support to run an embedded model locally.
