# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Currently, Kappa requires users to pay for Voyage AI API credits to use the embedding functionality that enables semantic similarity search for assembly functions. This creates a barrier to adoption for developers who want to try the tool or use it for personal projects. We need to implement a local embedding model approach that provides the same functionality as the Voyage API while being completely free and privacy-preserving.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to enable local embedding functionality through a command palette action, so that I can use Kappa's similarity search without requiring paid API credits.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I open the command palette THEN the system SHALL display a "Kappa: Enable Local Embedding Model" command
2. WHEN I execute the enable command THEN the system SHALL download and initialize the local embedding model
3. WHEN the local model is enabled THEN the system SHALL use it instead of Voyage AI for all embedding operations
4. WHEN the local model is being downloaded THEN the system SHALL show progress feedback to the user

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the local embedding model to provide the same API interface as Voyage AI, so that existing Kappa functionality works seamlessly without code changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the local embedding model processes assembly code THEN it SHALL return embeddings in the same format as Voyage AI
2. WHEN batch processing assembly functions THEN the local model SHALL handle batches of 25 functions like the current implementation
3. WHEN generating embeddings THEN the local model SHALL produce vector arrays compatible with existing similarity search
4. WHEN the embedding process completes THEN the results SHALL integrate with the existing database schema without modification

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the local embedding model to work completely offline, so that I can use Kappa without internet connectivity and maintain code privacy.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the local model is initialized THEN it SHALL function without requiring internet connectivity
2. WHEN processing assembly code THEN the system SHALL not transmit any data to external services
3. WHEN the model files are cached locally THEN subsequent uses SHALL not require re-downloading
4. WHEN working offline THEN all embedding functionality SHALL remain fully operational

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the local embedding model to provide similar quality results to Voyage AI, so that the similarity search remains effective for finding related assembly functions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN comparing assembly functions THEN the local model SHALL produce meaningful similarity scores
2. WHEN searching for similar functions THEN the results SHALL be relevant to the input assembly code
3. WHEN using the local model THEN the embedding quality SHALL be sufficient for effective prompt building
4. WHEN generating embeddings THEN the model SHALL handle assembly code syntax and patterns appropriately

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear feedback about the local embedding model status, so that I understand when it's available and functioning properly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the local model is not yet enabled THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate this in relevant UI elements
2. WHEN the model is downloading THEN the system SHALL show download progress and estimated time
3. WHEN the model is ready THEN the system SHALL confirm successful initialization
4. WHEN embedding operations are running THEN the system SHALL show progress similar to the current Voyage AI implementation

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to gracefully handle local model failures, so that I can troubleshoot issues or fallback to alternative approaches.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the local model fails to download THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and retry options
2. WHEN the model encounters runtime errors THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information
3. WHEN the local model is unavailable THEN the system SHALL continue to function with existing cached embeddings
4. WHEN model initialization fails THEN the system SHALL offer to re-download or reset the model files
